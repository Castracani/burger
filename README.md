# Eat-Da-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger is a one-page application that follows the Model, View, Controller (MVC) design pattern in order to utilize various API routes that create, read, and update user-given data. The data is stored and updated in a MySQL database, with an Object Relational Manager (ORM) used to pass between the database functions and the routes. The html pages are rendered utiziling `express-handlebars`.

## The application is currently down and being debugged! It will be up and running as soon as possible, and this README will be edited to showcase it's functionality when it's fully functional. ##
